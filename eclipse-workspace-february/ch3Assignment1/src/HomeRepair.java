/*
 * Herbertâ€™s Home Repair estimates each job cost as the cost of materials plus $35 per hour while on 
 * the job, plus $12 per hour for travel time to the job site.
 * The main() method prompts the user for the name of a job (for example, Smith bathroom remodel), 
 * the cost of materials, the number of hours of work required, and the number of hours travel time.
 * Pass the numeric data to a method that computes an estimate for the job and returns the computed 
 * value to the main() method which displays the job name and estimated price.
